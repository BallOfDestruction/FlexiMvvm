# FlexiMvvm Release Notes

## v.0.10.5 (preview)

### Existing functionality changes

- Switch on C# 8 for FlexiMvvm source code (main reason - nullable reference types support).
- Starting removing Jetbrains Code Annotations and replace them with nullable reference types.
- Replace `FlexiMvvm.Configuration.Config` class with `FlexiMvvm.Collections.ValueSet`(API not changed, just renaming).

### Bug fixes

- If navigate from ActivityA to ActivityB for result and ActivityA killed by the Android then app crashes if return back.
- Cascading return result doesn't work properly in iOS.

### Code documentation

- Bootstrappers*, Configuration*, Parameter, Result classes have been documented.

## v.0.10.4 (preview)

### Existing functionality changes

- Remove `OperationFactory property` from the `ViewModel` class.

### Bug fixes

- View models parameters are not passed to a `UITabBarController`.

## v.0.10.3 (preview)

### Existing functionality changes

 - FlexiMvvm-adapted activity doesn't throw an exception anymore in Activity.OnActivityResult callback if its model doesn't implement IViewModelWithResultHandler. Reason: activities might communicate with each other without transmission the result to the view model.

## v.0.10.2 (preview)

### New functionality

 - Added classes for view model to view [interactions](https://github.com/epam-xamarin-lab/FlexiMvvm/tree/master/FlexiMvvm.Common/Interactions).

### Existing functionality changes

 - ViewModel.InitializeAsync is called when UIViewController.ViewDidLoad/Activity.OnCreate methods completed. Previously it was called at the beginning of ViewDidLoad/OnCreate. It didn't allow access to views because there were not created yet.
 -  Now Config implements IConfig implicitly. Don't need to cast to IConfig to access GetView/SetView methods.

### Bug fixes

 - NavigationService.Navigate methods crash for iOS.

### Code documentation

 - All navigation classes have been documented.
